# Tripscore.eu: an intelligent agent for studying public transit information published as a Linked Connections archive

What if you could know beforehand which trains are more prone to delays, crowdedness or other inconveniences? Based on your personal preferences you could easily pick whichever train suits your needs the most.

The number of journeys in Ghent and Madrid is increasing due to the rapid growth these cities are experiencing. Trips made by cars are still way above those of other soft modes of transport (fiets, te voet) and public transport. The city of Ghent has the vision to create a livable and accessible city and one of the strategies is to promote the modal shift from private car use to public transport use. Ensuring and enhancing passenger’s quality of experience plays a major role in the shifting process. 
 
Tripscore is an analytical tool that measures the quality of experience of public transport and pre-inform/beforehand the passenger in order to impact the travel behavior and pattern. The goal of the project is to create a showcase for local governments to consider the way they publish data.

The more data is published by your public transport providers, the more quality of experience aspects (delays, fare prices, frequency, …) we can take into account. Using this data we match existing service qualities to your expectations and predict your quality of experience so you can pick the right train, tram or bus.

Whenever we talk about trains and delays everyone knows what we’re talking about thanks to our Linked Open Data approach. Computers, on the other hand are dumb and have no notion of these concepts. So we need to define a vocabulary or ontology about public transport for them to understand these concepts (somewhat similar to a dictionary for us to look up what a word means). These vocabularies can be made interoperable by linking a term in one vocabulary to a term in another vocabulary. For example, all over Europe, there are many public transport providers with their own vision on publishing open data. If you wanted to work with their data you’d have to take into account all the differences. Whereas if you’re using Linked Open Data the many different datasets can be used together because we can translate the terms from the vocabularies.

An app where you can choose what makes commuting more enjoyable to you and then look at how suitable certain trains or buses are for you. It takes your personal preferences such as punctuality, frequency and crowdedness into account. Then evaluates trips and gives them a score for every aspect and a score for the trip as a whole. Now you can start comparing trips to find the most suitable for you.

Thank you to our open Summer of code 2017 students, Jasper De Moor, Israel Ketema Elefenh, Robrecht Meersman, Bruno Haspeslagh and Pieter-Jan Vandenberghe.
Open Summer of Code is a 4-week summer programme that provides Belgian based students the training, network and support necessary to transform open innovation projects into powerful real-world services. This July 40 students are working in teams on 10 different open innovation projects provided by partnering organisations, companies and governments. The goal is to complete these projects by the end of the programme and turn them into real-world products and services.
